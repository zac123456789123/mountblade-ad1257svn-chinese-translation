menu_start_game_0|Welcome, adventurer, to Mount and Blade: Warband. Before beginning the game you must create your character.

Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start, but women and commoners can attain all of the same goals -- and in fact may have a much more interesting if more challenging early game.
